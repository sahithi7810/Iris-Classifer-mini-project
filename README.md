# Iris-Classifer-mini-project
The Iris Classification problem is a classic machine learning task that involves predicting the species of an iris plant based on its features. The dataset, often referred to as the Iris dataset, includes 150 samples of iris plants, divided into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters.

Using these features, classification algorithms (such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines) can be trained to accurately identify the species. This dataset is widely used for demonstrating basic machine learning principles, as itâ€™s small, well-balanced, and easy to visualize, making it ideal for beginners in supervised learning.

IMAGE CAPTURING:

Face recognition is a biometric technology used to identify or verify a person based on their facial features. It involves capturing an image or video frame of a face, detecting the face within the frame, and then analyzing key features (such as the distance between the eyes, nose, and mouth) to create a unique "faceprint."

This technology typically relies on machine learning and deep learning techniques to accurately identify individuals. It's widely used in security systems, access control, smartphone authentication, and social media tagging. Despite its utility, face recognition raises concerns around privacy, data security, and potential biases, making it an area of active research and ethical discussion.
